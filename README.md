# K-Median_K-Medoids
An implementation of K-Median and K-Medoids algorithms to cluster data.

This project was completed for an assignment in a Machine Learning course and seeks to explore the differences in the clustering
techniques: K-means, K-medians, and K-medoids. It revealed that as there is a linear relationship between the variability in the data
and the increasing k value.
